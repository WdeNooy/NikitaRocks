## Workshop Aims

Enhance understanding of:

1. Social contagion (influence) and relational events (social selection) as predicting attributes of persons or ties between persons (and between persons and other objects).
2. Behavioural network hypotheses as (predictive) effects of local configurations of ties and (node) attributes.
3. Assumptions about where (for or between whom) and when events may happen.

Offer R code examples and hands-on practice with:

1. Regression models: linear and logistic.
2. Multilevel (regression) models for repeated measurements and cross-nested designs.
3. Event history models: discrete-time and continuous-time (semi-parametric).

## Data

One or more simulated data sets, e.g., of fictional groups of children, that highlight the models that are presented.

Data is organized according to time-constant/time-varying and attribute/dyadic (max 4 data frames per data set).

## Activities and Learning Materials

Short plenary introduction to a topic using introductory materials in the tutorials) followed by individual/group work (if online: only in breakout rooms if individual problems have to be dealt with) using (a section in) a `learnr::` interactive tutorial.

Each tutorial (section) starts with basic/essential models and skills and offers optional more advanced models for those who have time left or for further study after the workshop. The general idea is that the tutorials offer materials and guidance that can be used individually afterwards.

## Title

Analysis of time-stamped network data.

Modelling events within social networks. (covers both social contagion and relational events)

## Schedule

Each course block lasts for 1.5 hours.

### Morning I, Part I - Contagion with linear regression

Introduction to:

0. Show animation of example network to illustrate time-stamped network data: changing ties, changing (personal) attributes. Brainstorm about what we could predict from what (involving which units of analysis)?

1. Regression models as statistical models for behavioural hypotheses. Our interest in network behaviour (e.g., group behaviour): How do persons change their states (e.g., attitudes, behaviour, infections - contagion) and their actions towards other persons (or objects - relational events)?

2. Events that are ordered in time as basic data that we try to predict (and explain). Timing distinction between predictor and outcome (in contrast to ERGM).

3. Exposure as predictor (and how to calculate that), requiring relation (dyadic data).

Data:

1. DV: voice loudness (during class breaks; event 'unit' is voice use for speech and expression, repeated measurements within one class break).

2. Dyadic: playmates (aggregated to best friends, subsequently as measured playing together?).

3. IV: voice loudness (of playmates) at a preceding time.

4. Controls: sex (boys louder), pupil-specific loudness level, max loudness in group, time since last playmate talking (main effect: quicker response increases loudness, possibly interaction effect), ...

Hands-on:

1. Checking correct installation of R, RStudio, `learnr::`, `gradethis::` (?), and `NikitaRocks::` (the tutorial and all of its dependencies).

2. Regression model with prepared exposure variable (loudness of last playmate talking), options for control variables (to stress importance of model specification): interaction exposure by sex (girls are more affected by their peers' loudness). Inspecting output: interpreting regression coefficients (ignore checks?).

3. Play with shiny app (TBD?) to inspect ego networks of pupils with small and large residuals. With option to show attributes?

4. Manipulation of the exposure variable and time (using stable friendship relations): only voice loudness of last friend, average voice loudness of all friends in a fixed preceding time window, time-weighted (half-life time).

5. Advanced: Calculation of the exposure variable and time (using stable friendship relations): only voice loudness of last friend, average voice loudness of all friends in a fixed preceding time window, time-weighted (half-life time).

6. Advanced: Using data on playing together to calculate exposure. 

### Morning I, Part II - Contagion with repeated measurements (multilevel - go Bayesian?)

Introduction to:

1. Problem of repeated measurements (of DV): dependencies among observations.

2. Multilevel model with varying intercepts as solution to repeated measurements model: personal inclination to be loud.

3. Added benefit of correcting for effects of unobserved personal characteristics (model specification).

4. Going Bayesian (with `rstan::`): Easier to fit complicated models (due to weakly informative priors), more intuitive interpretation of results (credible/posterior intervals), (easier model checks with predictive checks?) but more computer time.

Data: Same as Morning I, Part I.

Hands-on:

1. Specify a multilevel model with (`nlme::` or) `rstan::` and interpret varying intercepts.

2. ?? Predictive checks at pupil level? Inspect residuals/predictions as evolving network?

3. Predicting varying intercepts from time-constant personal attributes (and see that it hardly changes the exposure effects).

4. Advanced: Varying slopes for the exposure effect (model with exposure as score of last preceding playmate) as measure of influence/influentials in a cross-nested model. 

### Afternoon I, Part I - Contagion with logistic regression (multilevel, Bayesian)

Introduction to:

1. Logistic regression: meaning of regression coefficients in terms of probability changes.

2. Using (a little bit of) ego network structure for predicting contagion: complex contagion, closure.

Data:

1. DV: (day of) installing new game app.

2. Dyadic: Friendship and/or watching a peer use the game app (possibly with duration).

3. IV: number of friends who installed the new game app.

4. Controls: ...

Hands-on:

1. Multilevel regression model with prepared exposure variable (number of friends who installed the new game app): Inspecting output: interpreting fixed and varying regression coefficients (and residuals?). Demonstration with new game app adoption, additional practice with adoption of expression "wicked smaht" (every break a new episode?)

2. Play with shiny app (TBD?) to inspect ego networks of pupils with small and large residuals. With option to show attributes?

3. Complex contagion as exposure to more than one adopter: dichotomize number of friends who installed the app and compare results.

4. Advanced: Calculate closure (number of connected friends who have installed the app) and estimate its effect (while controlling for number of friends?).

### Afternoon I, Part II - Contagion with time (discrete time event history)

Introduction to:

1. Risk set and (right-) censoring.

2. Time-varying predictors (and covariates).

3. Discrete-time approach: creating relevant cases.

Data: Same as Afternoon I, Part I.

Hands-on:

1. Inspect (check) cases created and (time-varying) predictor.

2. Estimate multilevel model and interpret results (particularly the time effect?).

3. ?? Inspect predictions/residuals in ego-networks (shiny app)?

4. Advanced: Creation of cases and calculation of time-varying predictor.

5. Advanced: @@ (same as earlier this day or continue working on earlier topics?)

### Morning II, Part I - Relational events: Predicting event (tie) value

Introduction to:

1. Dyad/arc/ordered pair as unit of analysis in (logistic) regression. Hypothesize behaviour of sender towards recipient (of the relational event/action) __given that sender acts towards recipient__. 

2. Predictors from node attributes. Action valence (content) may depend on characteristics of the sender (not _activity_?), the recipient (_popularity_), and on the (dis)similarity of sender and recipient (_homophily_/_heterophily_).

3. Predictors from local network structure: durable relations or previous relational events, e.g., balance.

4. Varying intercepts for sender and recipient to capture effects of unobserved personal tendencies and 'popularity'.

Data:

1. DV: Positive versus negative action (support versus attack; praise versus bullying; in a setting of pairs of children that are assigned to work/play together?).

2. Dyadic IVs: 

3. Sender and/or receiver attribute IVs: 

4. Controls:

Hands-on:

1. Creating predictors. Understanding predictor creation and the choices involved by manually calculating some simple examples.

2. Using predictors, interpreting results.

@. Advanced: Specify cross-nested multilevel model and interpret 

### Morning II, Part II - Relational events: Predicting sender and (or) recipient

Introduction to:

1. Who will select whom next (given that there is a next relational event)? Combination of two processes: (a) who is going to act when? and (b) the action is directed towards whom? Possibly, a third process: (c) what is the nature of the action? 

2. With the types of predictors discussed in the previous session: @@.

3. Granularity of time: discrete versus continuous. Continuous-time event history model. Simplest (not so realistic) model: fixed probability of event occurrence over time (exponential).

4. Undirected example, e.g., playing together without one pupil taking the initiative. Processes: (a) @@@ . `goldfish::` can handle this.

5. Two-mode application, for example, choice or opinions on topics combined with relations between actors. `goldfish::` can handle 2-mode data.

6. Other special cases: incomplete risk sets. The sender or the recipient is fixed (exogeneous), e.g., a child is asked to choose a team. Risk set as eligible senders and/or recipients. We ask: Given that there is an action by sender (or towards recipient), why was this recipient/sender chosen?. Construction of cases.

7. Wrapping it up: Regression models for time-stamped network data require dealing with time (when does something happen?) and pairs (between whm does it happen?). What do you consider to be externally fixed, what do you want to predict: whether/when/how a person's charasteristic changes or whether/when/how/by whom/to whom an (inter)action appears?

8. `RSiena::` for panel wave data (only mention and give references).

Data:

1. DV: dichotomy for `goldfish::`, actually, presence versus absence of ties (estimating the probability or odds of tie as an event appearance). The fact that a pupil says something to another pupil.

2. Dyadic: 

3. IV: 

4. Controls:

Hands-on:

1. Estimate a dynamic network model with `goldfish::` package (https://sn.ethz.ch/research/goldfish.html); this package includes estimation of REMs (so `relevents::` not necessary) ; see https://github.com/snlab-ch/goldfish for potential installation problems on mac OSX)

2. Interpret the results. Recognize the local network structures represented by the effects.
