<h2>Analyzing ties</h2>
<p>In the preceding sessions, we have tried to predict a characteristic of a pupil (loudness, game app adoption). In network analytic terms, we have focused on the nodes of the network.</p>
<p>Let us now turn to the lines in the network, more specifically, the statements that pupils make toward each other. Can we predict if a statement made by one pupil to another pupil is negative or positive (not negative)?</p>
<p><img src="TieValence_files/figure-html/fragment1plot1-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>The above figure highlights (blue arrow) one example of a statement for which we want to predict if it is negative or positive. This is Lauren’s statement to Omar at time 22:28.</p>
<p>It shows the statement within its network context:</p>
<ul>
<li>Friendship relations (fat gray lines).</li>
<li>Current playmates: thin black lines.</li>
<li>Previous statements involving Lauren or Omar, started in the preceding 5 minutes. Green arrows indicate positive statements, red arrows negative statements. The older the statement, the more transparent the arrow.</li>

<h3>Effects on tie valence</h3>
<p>A tie is equal to a pair of nodes. For lines, the order of nodes (from versus to) does not matter, but the order matters for arcs (arrows). Instead of analyzing characteristics of nodes (pupils), we are now going to analyze a characteristic of pairs of nodes. In our example, whether a statement is positive or negative.</p>

<h3>Different types of independent/predictor variables</h3>
<p>The four questions in the preceding sub-topic represent different types of effects and different types of independent/predictor variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><i class="question">Sender-effect</i>: Effect of a characteristic of the sender of a tie. Example: Do girls on average make more or less negative statements to others?</li>
<li><i class="question">Receiver-effect</i>: Effect of a characteristic of the receiver of a tie. Example: Do boys on average attract more or less negative statements from others?</li>
<li><i class="question">(Dis)similarity effect</i>: Effect of a variable indicating whether sender and receiver have the same characteristic. Example: Do pupils tend to make more positive statements to peers with the same ethnicity than to pupils of other ethnicity?</li>
<li><i class="question">Other tie effect</i>: Effect of the presence or value of another relation between sender and receiver. Example: Do friends tend to receive more positive statements than pupils who are not friends?</li>
<li><i class="question">Same tie effect</i>: Effect of the presence or value of previous ties between sender and receiver on the same relation as the predicted tie. For example: Valence of the statements between Lauren and Omar in the preceding 5 minutes. If the network is directed (arcs/arrows), we distinguish between:
<ul>
<li><i class="question">Repetition/replication</i>: Presence or characteristics of a previous tie from sender to receiver. Example: a previous statement by Lauren to Omar.</li>
<li><i class="question">Reciprocity</i>: Presence or characteristics of a previous tie in de opposite direction, from receiver to sender. Example: a previous statement by Omar to Lauren.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><i class="question">Local network context effect</i>: Effect of the presence or value of network structures including (at least) a third node. Example: Does Lauren adjust the valence of her statement to the fact that Lauren had positive exchanges with Cambrie and Trevor, who said negative things to Omar?</li>

<p>Some options:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Only use Omar’s last statement directed at Lauren. If it was negative, the reciprocity predictor becomes 1, otherwise it becomes 0. Note: This is the variable <code>received_neg</code> in the data set <code>utterances</code>.</li>
<li>Subtract the number of positive statements from the the number of negative statements. If there are more negative statements, the reciprocity predictor is positive. If there are more positive statements, it is negative.</li>
<li>As 2, but weigh each statement, so more recent statements have higher weights.</li>

<h3>Balance (local network context)</h3>
<p>Effects including a third node (pupil) are typical for network analysis. Many effects are possible. Transitivity, which we will encunter in Session 6, is just one of them.</p>
<p>Let us focus on one example for a relation that is positive or negative: <i class="question">structural balance</i>.</p>
<p>Social psychological balance theory (related to the theory of cognitive dissonance) argues that human beings prefer to be friends of their friends, enemies of their friends’ enemies, and friends of their enemies’ enemies.</p>
<p>Translate ‘friend’ into a positive relation (green) and ‘enemy’ into a negative relation (red). Four situations are possible (if we neglect the direction of ties), see the figure below.</p>

<h3>Interpreting results</h3>
<p>In Session 3, we learned that effects in a logistic regression model are difficult to interpret because they predict changes in the log odds. We learned to use the <code>predict()</code> function to obtain predicted probabilities. In our present example, we predict probabilities of making a negative statement (in stead of a positive statement). Remember, <code>1</code> on variable <code>negative</code> stands for a negative statement!</p>

<p>In the estimated model, the predicted probability of a negative statement is higher for a pupil who received a negative statement from the addressee (<code>received_neg = 1</code>) than for a pupil who did not receive such a statement (<code>received_neg = 0</code>; all other things equal).</p>
<p>This is in line with the fact that the negative reciprocity effect was positive, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The higher value (<code>1</code> versus <code>0</code>) on the dependent/outcome variable (<code>negative</code>) represents a negative statement;</li>
<li>A higher value (<code>1</code> versus <code>0</code>) on the (negative) reciprocity predictor variable (<code>received_neg</code>) represents receiving a previous negative statement.</li>
<li>So a positive effect predicts a higher probability of a negative statement if the the (negative) reciprocity predictor variable is higher.</li>
</ul>
<p>If one of the two variables is coded differently (in the opposite direction), a negative effect would have indicated reciprocity.</p>

<h3>Cross-nested multilevel model</h3>
<p>But wait a minute, we have repeated observations for a pupil making a statement, don’t we? Pupils may make more than one statement, and each statement is an observation (row) in our data set.</p>
<p>Shouldn’t we correct for this with a multilevel model, as we earned in Session 2? Yes, we should!</p>
<p>In addition, we also have repeated observations for a pupil receiving a statement. A pupil may receive more than one statement during the break. We should also correct for this in our multilevel model.</p>
<p>A model with random (varying) effects for the pupil sending and the pupil receiving a statement is an example of a <i class="question">cross-nested multilevel model</i>.</p>

<p>Cross-nested logistic regression models are usually difficult to estimate. The approximation used by the <code>glmer()</code> function (in the <code>lme4</code> package) does not have to be very good.</p>
<p>If you want to use a cross-nested logistic regression model in your own research, it is better to use Bayesian estimation using the <code>rstanarm</code> package.</p>
<p>Finally, it is not clear how we can correct for repeated measurements with a multilevel model if we cannot distinguish between sender and receiver of the tie (that is, with an undirected relation).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this session, we have started predicting aspects of network structure, namely, characteristics of network ties.</p>
<p>We learned that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pairs of network nodes are our observations;</li>
<li>To formulate and test hypotheses about effects on a tie characteristic, we can use:
<ul>
<li>Characteristics of the two nodes;</li>
<li>(Dis)similarities of these characteristics;</li>
<li>Ties on other relations;</li>
<li>Previous ties, possibly including more network nodes than the sender and receiver (reciprocity, structural balance).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We can (again) use logistic regression.</li>
<li>We may have to control for repeated measurements for both nodes with a cross-nested multilevel model.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this session, we have assumed that the ties exist. We have analyzed the valence (positive versus negative) of statements under the condition that the statements were made.</p>
<p>In the next session, we turn to the presence versus absence of ties. Can we predict that a pupil says something to another pupil or starts playing with another pupil at a particular moment?</p>
